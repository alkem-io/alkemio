# Developer Documentation

Hi, Thank you for being interested in helping to contribute to CherryTwist.

Currently this documentation might be a bit sparse but hopefully in time it can help you get up to speed quickly.
Please read the [contributing](https://github.com/cherrytwist/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide lines to understand how to participate in this project.

## Getting Started
Currently we are in the process of road mapping and getting the first code down. Therefore there the best place to get started now is looking at the issues and helping us bootstrap.

Once we have a working base system, we will update this documentation to help you get started.

## Coordination
For coordinating and working on this project we use several different tools:

Name | Use
---- | ---
Gdrive | Ephemeral storing for quick collaboration. These should be made into issues once the ideas are more formulated.
GitHub Issues | Place to talk about issues, bugs, tasks, road map, etc. This is the main hub of the project.
ZenHub | Alternative interface for GitHub Issues.
Discord | Place for quick conversations about CherryTwist.

If you are contributing to the project we will add you to the Discord and Gdrive. If we have not done so, please notify **GhostOnTheFiber** or another Contributor and we will let you in.

## Need help

If at any point you would like more information, have an issue, want to be added to our chat platform, etc. reach out to **GhostOnTheFiber** and they will point your in the right direction. It might take a couple of days, so please be understanding.
