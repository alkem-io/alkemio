# Developer Documentation

This is the starting point for understanding the development setup used within CherryTwist as well as how to get started with contributing to the project.

Currently this documentation might be a bit sparse but hopefully in time it can help you get up to speed quickly.
Please read the [contributing](https://github.com/cherrytwist/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide lines to understand how to participate in this project.

## Getting Started
Currently we are in the process of creating a road map, landing the technical design and getting the first code down. Therefore the best place to get started now is looking at the issues and helping us bootstrap.

Once we have a working base system, we will update this documentation to help you get started.

## Coordination
The coordination of this project is based primarily on GitHub issues, augmented by Zenhub for a more agile interface to the backlog. 

Name | Use
---- | ---
GitHub Issues | Place to talk about issues, bugs, tasks, road map, etc. The primary backlog / source of information.
[ZenHub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/cherrytwist-5ecb98b262ebd9f4aec4194c) | Alternative interface for GitHub Issues.

And of course the repository itself for all documentation.

In addition for core contributors the following interaction locations are supported: 
Name | Use
---- | ---
Discord | Place for quick conversations about CherryTwist.
Gdrive | For temporary working material, especially working drafts that are evolving rapidly and where google docs are more effective. Once designs stabilise down they are converted into MD files within the repo. 

If you are contributing to the project the default path is to fork and submit a pull request; if you are interested in becomgin a core contributor then please reachout via <community@cherrytwist.or>.

## Development Process
The development process in use is largely based on the [default process suggested by Zenhub](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010341). 

## Need help

If at any point you would like more information, have an issue, want to be added to our chat platform, etc. reach out via via <community@cherrytwist.or> to directly **GhostOnTheFiber** and they will point your in the right direction. It might take a couple of days, so please be understanding.
