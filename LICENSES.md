The Stichting Alkemio ("Stichting") reserves all rights to the works that belong to the Sitchting published on this GitHub account. Nevertheless, reuse is permitted under the following conditions.

First - The work that is created in the ALkemio project, is available under the EU-PL license; and any outside contributions to it are under an [individual Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/alkem-io/.github/blob/master/CLA.md) ("CLA") that references this license explicitly.

However - that does not mean that all (derived) work is solely under that single license. For example - where appropriate certain (open source) modules may be required and included. These will remain under their original Copyright and License (though some may be released under the EU-PL license if they are unsuitable to be contributed back upstream).

Secondly  The documents of this project that can be considered ‘documentation’ (e.g. files not related to code/configuraton) are released under the CC0 license ([see](CC0-LICENSE.md)). If you use (parts) of these documents, you are not obliged to quote the source, but you must not imply that the Stichting endorses the derivative work.

The CC0 does not apply to:
 
- Patent rights and trademark rights.
- Third-party rights. 
 
Finally  The EU-PL license and the CC0 do not apply to photos, videos, infographics or other forms of images. It is therefore not permitted to reuse or transfer the image, unless the image explicitly states that it is permitted or you have received written permission of the Stichting. Such permission will not be withheld on unreasonable grounds.
