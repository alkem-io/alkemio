# CherryTwist Personas
This document captures the key personas that are currently identified and being elaborated for the CherryTwist.

At a high level, the following primary categories of personas identified:
* Organisational: representing legal entities that are either driving a particular challenge or helping across challenges
* Individual: a user, either contributing directly or via an organisation
* Group: one or more individuals working together as a unit

Note: these personas are currently heavily influenced from experience within the Odyssey ecosystem; it will be an on-going process to drive to generic representations / names for the different personas. 

Note: In addition it should be feasible for Challenge Hosts to extend the set of roles that they support within their challenge template.
