# CherryTwist Personas
This document captures the key personas that are currently identified and being elaborated for the CherryTwist.

At a high level, there are two primary categories of personas identified:
* Organisation: representing legal entities / groups of individuals
* Individual: a user, either contributing directly or via an organisation

Note: these personas are currently heavily influenced from experience within the Odyssey ecosystem; it will be an on-going process to drive to generic representations / names for the different personas. 

Note: In addition it should be feasible for Challenge Hosts to extend the set of roles that they support within their challenge template.
