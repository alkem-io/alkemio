# CherryTwist Design + Enhancements Process
This document captures the CherryTwist design and enhancements process. 

All design material shall be placed as markdown files within this repostiory; however for convenience while designs are rapidly iterating very early versions of designs are being worked via google docs that are visible to all project contributors. If you would like to be considered for contributor access then please reach out to <community@cherrytwist.org>. 

# Conceptual Design
The set of concepts and terms used for the design of CherryTwist can be found [here](./ConceptualDesign.md).

It is important to read this document first, as a lot of the terminology used in the rest of the design documentation as well as the code is described here - so having this mental model clear helps. 

# Technical Design
An introduction to the technical design for CherryTwist can be found [here](./TechnicalDesign.md).
