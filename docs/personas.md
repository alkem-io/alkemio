# Alkemio Personas
This document captures the key personas that are currently identified and being elaborated for the Alkemio.

At a high level, the following primary categories of personas identified:
* Legal: representing legal entities that are either driving a particular challenge or helping across challenges
* Natural: a person, either contributing directly or via a legal persona.
* Group: one or more individuals working together as a unit

An identity can be assigned multiple personas, and in particular for Natural personas they can be stacked e.g. a Specialist "is a" Contributor.

Note: these personas are currently heavily influenced from experience within the Odyssey ecosystem; it will be an on-going process to drive to generic representations / names for the different personas. 

Note: In addition it should be feasible for Challenge Hosts to extend the set of roles that they support within their challenge template.
