Each repository itself contains documentation that is specific for that component.

## Coordination
The coordination of this project is based primarily on GitHub issues, augmented by Zenhub for a more agile interface to the backlog.

Each repo has its own set of issues.

[This](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio) repo is used for issues / discussions that span the whole project. 

All Epics are in the Alkemio repo.

The [ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/Alkemio-5ecb98b262ebd9f4aec4194c) spans all active repositories and brings all open issues into a joined up backlog. 

There is a **Discord** for more in lace for quick conversations about Alkemio, daily standups etc.

If you are contributing to the project the default path is to fork and submit a pull request.

Finally, for discussions about ideas, needing help, collaborations etc, please check out our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions).
