GUI interface specification of [xxx] component
==============================================

If the component contains a graphical userface, the specification should be
in the form of user stories (https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-stories/); the appearance of
the various GUI components could be given in wireframes. Do not put weight on
the visual aspect of each component, but on the interaction steps and the views
with which the user will interact.
