# CherryTwist
Welcome to CherryTwist - an open source infractructure for multi-stakeholder collaboration leveraging digital ecosystems. 

This repository is for coordination around the project - still in the startup phase but aiming to get the basics right from the get go so please do

# Introduction
So what is a "Digital Ecosystem" and why do we need a new infrastructure? 

## Digital Ecosystem
Gartner defines a Digital Ecosystem as: *“Digital ecosystems leverage an interdependent group of actors (enterprises, people and things) sharing digital platforms to achieve a mutually beneficial purpose.”*. 

In a digital first world, it is clear that “Digital has revolutionized the level and intensity of connections among business partners, customers and all others who participate in the creations, delivery and capture of value. Digital connections and advanced technology change how value is exchanged, what value can be exchanged (e.g.,monetary, data, tokens for any kind of value), the speed at which it is exchanged, and where and with whom it can be exchanged.”

But to fully realise this value we need an infrastructure designed with open innovation and digital collaboration in mind - hence CherryTwist!

## Targetted Functionalities
The solution space is still being actively framed / captured - but some aspects are already clear: 
- Initiate, set-up and broadcast your challenge to the world
- Find and add stakeholders with an interest for adoption
- Grow social graphs around your challenge (knowledge, capability, capacity)
- Find and add contributors that can help build solutions, from individuals to teams to companies to governments
- Clarify and formalise agreements between multiple contributors (potentially via new entities, joint statements)
- Collectively govern projects to achieve common goals
- Collectively resource, including using bounties to incentivise contributors to deliver milestones
- Collectively manage work products generated, including IP generated, trademarks etc.
- Facilitating communication and interactions around the challenge
...and likely many more. There are many aspects that can play into this.

And of course to do this while leveraging the latest technical capabilityes such as Self Sovereign Identity, verified credentials (trust, reputation), formalised agreements etc etc - without exposing those details to the end user! 

No small challenge - but one that can delivery huge value...
