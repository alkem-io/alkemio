Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central.  

<p></p>

## Why Alkemio?
Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing. 

Creating an open innovation platform is a pragmatic offering in the context of the wider vision: <i>"Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together."</i>

The core concept is a **Challenge**, creating a **shared understanding** of where we are now so that we can start making progress **towards** a new reality. But making progress in a hyper connected society is simply hard: there are typically multiple stakeholders that need to be involved. Hence out belief that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do **[check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.](./docs/why-alkemio.md)**.

## How do I get started?
The easiest way to get started with Alkemio is to see it in action! For that there are a couple of options:
* **[Demo Environment](https://demo.alkem.io)** - a non-production environment illustrating how multiple organizations / users can host Challenges on a single hub, allowing the community to be shared across all Challenges and users to find Challenges that they want to contribute to. 
  * If you are interested in having your own Challenges Space on the demo environment to try it out please reach out via <community@alkem.io>!.  
* **[Try it out locally](https://www.github.com/alkem-io/demo)** - create your own local Alkemio instance and populate it with sample data. Recommended for the more hands on :)
