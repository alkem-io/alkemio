# Alkemio: Open Innovation Platform 
Alkemio is an open source, open innovation platform. It puts the Challenges central. 

Note: Alkemio used to be called Cherrytwist, so you may still see this name appearing in documentation / code etc. 



<p></p>

## Why Alkemio?
Alkemio is about enabling open innovation, across all aspects of society. Connecting. Aligning. Sharing. Enabling society to collaborate. Building a better future, together. 

The core concept is a Challenge, moving from where we are now to a new reality. But in a hyper connected society that involves multi-stakeholder collaboration, which is simply hard - and we believe that a lot more innovation is needed in how we collaborate.

There is plenty more to tell - so please do **[check out a more in-depth explanation of why we need to innovate in how we collaborate, and how we hope an open innovation platform can help.](./docs/why-alkemio.md)**.
